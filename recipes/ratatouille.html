        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Unless you are a chef or you like to cook a lot of different stuff, I think that everybody saw this recipe in the DIsney movie,
            and also everyone went to try it after it, I did it like 10 years later of the release (really quick), and I think if I did it before I haven't like it so much as now (I didn't enjoy vegetables in my meal),
            but the expression of Ego when tasting it was not unreal, <strong>this dish is an explosion of flavors that surprises you since it is a very easy dish to cook</strong>, it just requires patience.

            This is a French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables, originating in Nice, 
            and sometimes referred to as <em>ratatouille niçoise.</em>
            Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include tomato, 
            garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant), capsicum (bell pepper), 
            and some combination of leafy green herbs common to the region.

        <h3>- Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Spread tomato paste into the bottom of a 10x10-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with onion and garlic and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil and water until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and black pepper. 
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper, starting at the outer edge of the dish and working concentrically towards the center. Overlap the slices a little to display the colors. Drizzle the vegetables with 3 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Cover vegetables with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender, about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese.
